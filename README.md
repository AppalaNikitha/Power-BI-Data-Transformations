This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a bank transaction dataset using **Power Query in Power BI** to prepare it for accurate reporting. 
I performed key data-cleaning steps such as fixing inconsistent data types, expanding the date field into year/month/day components, 
unpivoting the category table, and filtering out low-value transactions below ₹100. I also created a merchant-level transaction summary 
to support better analysis. Finally, I built a simple **Power BI dashboard**—my first-ever dashboard—to visualize transaction trends,
merchant performance, and spending patterns.
